# User Persona: The Logistics Parent

**Project:** Camp Planner
**Created:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** Hypothetical — based on problem framing, not yet validated by research

## Who They Are

A working parent — often in a dual-income household, sometimes a single parent — with one to three school-age children between the ages of 5 and 14. They have some spending capacity for summer programs ($500–$3,000 per child per summer) and live in an area where program options are plentiful enough to require real evaluation and planning. They have already learned, often the hard way, that desirable programs fill months before summer starts.

**Representative name:** Morgan
**Household:** Two working parents, two kids (ages 7 and 10)
**Planning style:** Organized by necessity, not by nature. Builds systems because chaos is expensive.

## How They Work

Morgan starts thinking about summer in February or March — earlier for competitive programs that open registration in January. The process starts as a list: programs they've heard of, camps the kids liked last year, new options worth investigating. That list lives somewhere improvised — a Google Sheet, a shared Note, a doc — alongside dates scraped from individual program websites.

Morgan registers for more programs than the kids will actually attend. This is intentional: overbooking is the hedge against programs filling up or not working out. The cost of overbooking is managing the cancellation windows carefully, which requires knowing the refund policy for every program and checking in before each deadline.

The goal is a summer where every week is covered and neither parent needs to scramble for backup childcare.

## What They Need

- **A single place to track everything.** Right now the list, the dates, and the status live in different places. Moving between them creates errors and omissions.
- **Visibility into which weeks are covered.** The instinct is to think about individual programs, but the actual problem is weekly coverage. A calendar or week-by-week view that shows gaps is more useful than a list.
- **Proactive deadline alerts.** Morgan knows the deadlines are in the spreadsheet. But life gets busy and the spreadsheet doesn't push reminders. Missed cancellation deadlines mean lost money.
- **Financial clarity.** Total committed spend, potential refunds from pending cancellations, and the cost of confirmed programs are hard to see at a glance. The financial picture matters when making commit vs. cancel decisions.

## What Success Looks Like

Going into June feeling organized, not anxious. Every week is covered. No registration deadlines were missed because they snuck up. No surprise cancellation fees because the window closed before Morgan noticed. The summer plan was built once, updated as decisions were made, and didn't require a spreadsheet archaeology session every time a question came up.

## Current Workarounds and Their Failure Modes

| Workaround | What works | Where it breaks |
|---|---|---|
| Google Sheet with program list | Flexible, shareable | No reminders, no visual coverage view, requires manual upkeep |
| Google Calendar events for deadlines | Reminders work | No connection to program context — "What is this deadline for again?" |
| Notes / doc for research | Easy to add to | Unstructured, hard to act on |
| Memory | Fast | Unreliable; the first thing lost under load |

## Open Research Questions

These hypotheses about Morgan need validation before they should drive product decisions:

1. **When does the pain actually peak?** Is it in January when registration opens, March when decisions compound, or May when cancellation windows start closing?
2. **Is overbooking universal, or is it a behavior of experienced parents?** First-time summer planners may not know to do this yet.
3. **How many programs does a typical parent track at once?** 5? 15? The answer affects whether a simple list or a more structured tool is needed.
4. **Is the primary user one parent, or is the plan actively shared between two parents?** If shared, collaboration features become more important than they appear in the solo-user framing.
5. **Does this problem feel like a "summer camp problem" to users, or a "childcare planning problem"?** The framing affects what language resonates in messaging.
