## Problem

Parents with school-age children face a recurring, high-stakes planning problem every summer. Tracking programs, deadlines, overbooking positions, fees, and weekly coverage across multiple children is complex enough that existing general-purpose tools — spreadsheets, calendar apps — consistently fail them. The result is missed deadlines, surprise fees, and gap weeks.
