# Workbook

A Dynamic Reputation Marketplace for skilled labor. Workers send Before/Progress/Completed photos via WhatsApp, and an AI Trust Engine builds a verified digital portfolio — their "Reference Book."

**Brief:** [`briefs/strategic-initiative-brief.md`](briefs/strategic-initiative-brief.md)

## Problem

Skilled immigrant and general labor lack a portable, digital "System of Record" for their craftsmanship. Their career progression is trapped in a "word-of-mouth" cycle, making them invisible to new high-value opportunities.

## Solution

An AI-powered "Zero-UI" portfolio built on WhatsApp — where the workforce already lives.

- **Primary interface:** WhatsApp-based ingestion engine. The worker's phone number is their account ID and unique identifier.
- **User action:** Workers send photos tagged as Before, Progress, or Completed.
- **AI Trust Engine:** Computer Vision maps visual consistency across progress photos. EXIF data (GPS, timestamps) prevents fraud.
- **Peer validation:** A "Proximity Protocol" where nearby verified peers on the same job site vouch for the work's quality.

The pivot is from a static resume builder to a Dynamic Reputation Marketplace anchored in "Proof of Work" — translating daily physical actions into verified digital equity.

## Four Risks Audit

Following Marty Cagan's framework:

| Risk | Level | Analysis |
|---|---|---|
| **Value** | High | Solved by shifting value from "accountability to the boss" to "career mobility for the worker." |
| **Usability** | Low | Solved by meeting workers in WhatsApp rather than forcing a new app download or login. |
| **Feasibility** | Medium/High | Focuses on the "Truth Engine" — can AI distinguish quality in messy, real-world construction environments? |
| **Business Viability** | Anchored | Anchored on the Global Labor Shortage. GCs pay for the reduction in "Hiring Risk" and automated "Daily Logs." |

## Marketplace Dynamics

| Side | Driver |
|---|---|
| **Supply — Labor** | "Social Credit" and gamification: badges, skill tiers, peer respect. Workers build equity with every photo. |
| **Demand — General Contractors** | Access to a "Verified-Only" labor pool and automated compliance/reporting. Reduces hiring risk. |
