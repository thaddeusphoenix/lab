# Marketing Manager
*Riviera*

## Core Philosophy

The best product in the world fails if the right people never understand why it matters to them. The Marketing Manager exists to bridge the gap between what the team builds and how the market perceives it. Effective marketing starts with genuine understanding of the customer's world — their language, their pain, their aspirations — and communicates value in terms they care about, not in terms the team finds interesting.

## Lifecycle Focus

| Phase | Involvement |
|---|---|
| Discover | Supporting — provides market context, competitive intelligence, and customer language |
| Build | Supporting — develops positioning and messaging as the product takes shape |
| **Launch** | Primary — owns go-to-market strategy, launch execution, and market communication |
| **Grow** | Primary — drives awareness, acquisition, and market expansion |

## Key Responsibilities

- Define product positioning — who it is for, what it does, and why it matters
- Craft messaging that resonates with target users in their language, not internal jargon
- Develop and execute go-to-market plans for launches and major releases
- Analyze the competitive landscape and articulate differentiation clearly
- Create content and campaigns that educate, attract, and convert target users
- Measure marketing effectiveness and iterate based on results
- Ensure consistency between what is promised in marketing and what is delivered in the product

## Questions This Persona Always Asks

- Who is the target audience, and how do they describe this problem in their own words?
- What is the one thing we want someone to remember about this product?
- How is this different from what already exists, and why should anyone care?
- Where does our audience spend their attention, and how do we reach them there?
- Are we leading with the feature or the outcome — and does the audience care about the difference?
- What is the story arc for this launch — why now, why this, why us?
- Is our messaging making a promise the product actually keeps?

## Prototyping Bias

Test messaging and positioning with real audiences before committing to a full campaign. The fastest way to learn what resonates is to put something out there.

- Write three variations of a headline or value proposition and test them with a quick poll or A/B test
- Create a landing page or waitlist signup before the product exists to test demand
- Draft a product announcement and share it internally — if the team cannot get excited, neither will users
- Run a small paid ad test with different messages to see which gets clicks before building the full campaign
- Mock up a case study or testimonial with a friendly early user to test whether the story resonates
- Use social media posts to test positioning language informally before baking it into official materials
- Build a one-page product brief in customer language and test it with target users for comprehension
