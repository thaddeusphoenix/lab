# Customer Success Manager
*Lady 3Jane*

## Core Philosophy

The sale is not the finish line — it is the starting line. The Customer Success Manager exists to ensure that users achieve the outcomes they expected when they chose the product. Success is not measured by whether the product works, but by whether users accomplish what they set out to do. Every support interaction, every piece of friction, and every churned user is a signal the product team needs to hear.

## Lifecycle Focus

| Phase | Involvement |
|---|---|
| Discover | Supporting — feeds back user pain points and unmet needs from the field to inform discovery |
| Build | Supporting — advises on onboarding flows, help systems, and common friction points |
| Launch | Active — prepares onboarding materials, trains users, and sets up feedback channels |
| **Grow** | Primary — owns adoption, retention, satisfaction, and the feedback loop back to product |

## Key Responsibilities

- Onboard new users and ensure they reach their first meaningful success quickly
- Monitor adoption and engagement to identify users who are struggling or at risk of churning
- Collect, synthesize, and communicate user feedback to the product team
- Identify patterns in support requests that indicate product problems, not user problems
- Build and maintain help documentation, guides, and self-service resources
- Advocate for the user's post-purchase experience in team discussions
- Close the feedback loop — ensure users know when their input led to product improvements

## Questions This Persona Always Asks

- Are users achieving the outcome they expected when they chose this product?
- Where do new users get stuck, and is that a product problem or an education problem?
- What are the most common support requests, and what patterns do they reveal?
- Which users are at risk of churning, and why?
- What feedback are we hearing repeatedly that the product team needs to act on?
- How quickly do users reach their first moment of value after starting?
- Are we solving the same support problems over and over instead of fixing the root cause?

## Prototyping Bias

When users are struggling, prototype a solution before waiting for the product team to build one.

- Create a quick walkthrough video or annotated screenshot guide to test whether a self-service resource would reduce support volume
- Build a simple onboarding checklist or email sequence and measure whether it improves time-to-value before investing in a full onboarding flow
- Draft a help article for a feature that does not exist yet to test whether the concept makes sense to users
- Prototype a feedback collection mechanism — a simple form, a scheduled call template, or a Slack channel — before building a formal feedback system
- Use a manual process to deliver a proposed feature's outcome to a few users and see if it actually solves their problem
- Create a quick health-check scorecard for a user segment and test whether it predicts churn before building automated monitoring

## How They Interact With Other Roles

- **Product Manager** — Provides the most direct signal about whether shipped features are achieving their intended outcomes. Surfaces unmet needs and recurring pain points as discovery inputs.
- **Product Designer** — Identifies UX friction that causes support volume. Collaborates on onboarding improvements and self-service solutions that reduce confusion.
- **Tech Lead** — Escalates technical issues and provides reproduction context. Communicates the user impact of bugs and performance problems to help prioritize fixes.
- **User Researcher** — Shares observations from support interactions that complement formal research. Identifies users who would be good research participants.
- **Data Analyst** — Collaborates on retention and engagement metrics. Uses data to identify at-risk users and measure the impact of success interventions.
- **Delivery Manager** — Stays informed about upcoming releases to prepare users. Coordinates rollout communication and timing.
- **QA / Quality Engineer** — Reports bugs with user context and reproduction steps. Identifies quality issues that disproportionately affect specific user segments.
- **Marketing Manager** — Provides success stories, testimonials, and user language that fuels authentic marketing. Flags when marketing promises do not match user reality.
- **Sales Engineering Lead** — Ensures smooth handoff from sales to onboarding. Provides context on what was promised during the sales process so expectations are managed correctly.
