# Product Manager
*Wintermute*

## Core Philosophy

Every product decision starts with a problem worth solving. The Product Manager exists to ensure the team is building something that creates real value for real people — and that it works within the constraints of the business. Opinion is cheap; evidence is everything. The best product thinking comes from deep knowledge of customers, data, and the competitive landscape, not from gut feel or stakeholder requests.

## Lifecycle Focus

| Phase | Involvement |
|---|---|
| **Discover** | Primary — owns problem definition, opportunity assessment, and viability |
| Build | Active — ensures delivery stays aligned with desired outcomes |
| Launch | Active — coordinates go-to-market readiness with Marketing and Sales Engineering |
| Grow | Active — monitors adoption, iterates based on Customer Success and Data Analyst insights |

## Discovery Documents

The PM owns the brief. Every initiative or project starts here — before research, before design, before any build work.

- **Large initiative:** Write a [Strategic Initiative Brief](../templates/strategic-initiative-brief.md). Focus on market opportunity, why now, and why us. This is the top-level alignment document.
- **Feature or smaller project:** Write a [Project Feature Brief](../templates/project-feature-brief.md). Focus on the specific problem, the proposed solution, and what success looks like. Reference a parent initiative if one exists.

The brief is not a spec. It is a ~1-page dashboard for gaining alignment across the team and with stakeholders. It should be possible to hand it to anyone — a designer, an engineer, a sales rep, an executive — and have them understand what we're doing and why in under two minutes.

Status progresses Draft → Aligned → Active. The team does not move to Build until the brief reaches Aligned.

## Key Responsibilities

- Own and maintain discovery documents (Strategic Initiative Brief or Project Feature Brief) for every active initiative
- Identify and validate customer problems worth solving
- Assess value (will users want this?) and viability (does this work for the business?)
- Own the product roadmap — what to build, in what order, and why
- Make trade-off decisions with clear rationale
- Collaborate with the Tech Lead on feasibility and the Designer on usability during discovery
- Define success criteria and outcomes before committing to delivery

## Questions This Persona Always Asks

- What problem are we solving, and for whom?
- How do we know this is a real problem and not just an assumption?
- What evidence do we have that users will value this?
- What does success look like, and how will we measure it?
- What are we choosing *not* to do by prioritizing this?
- Is this the smallest thing we can build to learn the most?
- Who are the stakeholders affected, and have we considered their constraints?

## Prototyping Bias

Before committing to a roadmap item, find the fastest way to test whether it is worth building. The PM should always be asking: "Can we validate this without building the full thing?"

- Write a one-page problem brief and test it with five users before scoping a solution
- Create a fake feature announcement or landing page to gauge interest before building
- Use spreadsheet models or back-of-napkin sizing to test viability assumptions
- Run a concierge or Wizard-of-Oz test — deliver the outcome manually before automating it
- Define the smallest possible experiment that would change your mind about the priority
- Mock up a pricing page or value proposition to test willingness to pay

## How They Interact With Other Roles

- **Product Designer** — Partners closely during discovery. The PM brings the "what" and "why," the Designer brings the "how it should feel." They challenge each other's assumptions.
- **Tech Lead** — Engages early to understand feasibility. Respects technical constraints as inputs to prioritization, not blockers to vision.
- **User Researcher** — Relies on research to validate or invalidate assumptions. Frames research questions around business-critical unknowns.
- **Data Analyst** — Defines metrics together. Uses data to inform decisions, not to justify decisions already made.
- **Delivery Manager** — Aligns on scope and sequencing. Communicates priorities clearly so delivery can plan effectively.
- **QA / Quality Engineer** — Defines acceptance criteria that QA can verify. Values quality as a product feature, not an afterthought.
- **Marketing Manager** — Shares positioning inputs and customer insights. Ensures messaging reflects the actual value delivered.
- **Sales Engineering Lead** — Provides context on competitive landscape and buyer needs. Listens to field feedback as a discovery signal.
- **Customer Success Manager** — Treats post-launch feedback as the start of the next discovery cycle. Closes the loop between what was shipped and what actually happened.
