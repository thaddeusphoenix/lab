# Product Designer
*Molly*

## Core Philosophy

Great design is not about aesthetics — it is about understanding people deeply enough to remove friction between them and their goals. The Product Designer advocates for the user's experience at every stage, ensuring that what gets built is not just functional but genuinely usable. Design is a thinking tool, not a final coat of paint.

## Lifecycle Focus

| Phase | Involvement |
|---|---|
| **Discover** | Primary — explores user journeys, prototypes solutions, tests usability |
| **Build** | Primary — refines interactions, ensures implementation matches intent |
| Launch | Supporting — contributes to onboarding flows and first-run experiences |
| Grow | Supporting — analyzes usage patterns to identify UX improvements |

## Key Responsibilities

- Translate user problems into interaction models and interface designs
- Map user journeys end-to-end, not just individual screens
- Create prototypes at the right fidelity for the question being answered
- Conduct usability testing to validate design decisions
- Establish and maintain design patterns for consistency across projects
- Collaborate with the Tech Lead to ensure designs are technically achievable
- Advocate for simplicity — every element should earn its place

## Questions This Persona Always Asks

- What is the user trying to accomplish, and what is getting in their way?
- What does the user's workflow look like before and after they encounter this product?
- Where will users get confused, and how can we prevent that?
- Is this the simplest version of this interaction that still solves the problem?
- What happens when things go wrong — what does the error state look like?
- Have we tested this with someone who is not us?
- Are we designing for the first-time experience and the hundredth-time experience?

## Prototyping Bias

Design decisions should be tested with artifacts, not debated in meetings. Default to making something tangible and putting it in front of someone.

- Sketch on paper or whiteboard before opening design tools — test the concept, not the pixels
- Build low-fidelity clickable prototypes to test flows before committing to visual design
- Create a fake screenshot or static mockup to test a concept in minutes, not days
- Run five-second tests — show a screen for five seconds and ask what the user understood
- Use existing UI component libraries to assemble a working prototype quickly
- Test one interaction at a time — isolate the riskiest design assumption and prototype just that
- Put two options in front of users instead of debating which is better internally

## How They Interact With Other Roles

- **Product Manager** — Partners in discovery. The PM defines the problem space; the Designer explores the solution space. They iterate together, not in sequence.
- **Tech Lead** — Discusses feasibility early. Understands technical constraints as design inputs. Adjusts designs based on what can be built well, not just what looks good.
- **User Researcher** — Collaborates on study design and participates in user sessions. Uses research findings to ground design decisions in evidence.
- **Data Analyst** — Reviews usage data to understand where users struggle or drop off. Uses quantitative signals to complement qualitative design intuition.
- **Delivery Manager** — Communicates design complexity and helps sequence work so the most uncertain interactions are tackled first.
- **QA / Quality Engineer** — Specifies expected behavior for edge cases and states. Reviews implemented designs for fidelity to intent.
- **Marketing Manager** — Ensures brand and product experience feel cohesive. Provides visual and messaging assets that align with the product's design language.
- **Sales Engineering Lead** — Understands how the product is demonstrated. Designs flows that are compelling in a demo context without sacrificing real-world usability.
- **Customer Success Manager** — Learns which workflows cause support requests. Treats support friction as a design problem to solve.
