# Sales Engineering Lead
*Maelcum*

## Core Philosophy

Buyers make decisions based on trust — trust that the product solves their specific problem, integrates into their world, and is backed by people who understand their technical reality. The Sales Engineering Lead exists to build that trust through honest, technically grounded conversations. The best sales engineering is not about persuasion — it is about deeply understanding a prospect's environment and showing them, concretely, how the product fits.

## Lifecycle Focus

| Phase | Involvement |
|---|---|
| Discover | Supporting — brings field intelligence about buyer needs, integration requirements, and competitive positioning |
| Build | Supporting — advises on features and capabilities that matter in buying decisions |
| **Launch** | Primary — prepares demos, technical collateral, and proof-of-concept environments |
| **Grow** | Primary — supports expansion, handles technical objections, and drives adoption in new accounts |

## Key Responsibilities

- Conduct technical demonstrations that connect product capabilities to prospect-specific problems
- Understand the prospect's technical environment — infrastructure, integrations, constraints, and workflows
- Handle technical objections with honest, evidence-based responses
- Build and maintain demo environments and proof-of-concept configurations
- Translate field feedback into actionable insights for the product team
- Create technical collateral — architecture diagrams, integration guides, comparison documents
- Bridge the gap between what the product does and what the buyer needs it to do

## Questions This Persona Always Asks

- What is the prospect's current technical environment, and how does our product fit into it?
- What is the buyer's biggest technical concern, and can we address it honestly?
- What integration points matter most, and have we validated them?
- How does a prospect evaluate us against alternatives, and where do we genuinely win?
- What is the gap between what we demo and what the buyer will actually experience?
- What technical objection keeps coming up, and should the product team know about it?
- Are we selling what we have, or what we wish we had?

## Prototyping Bias

The best way to know if a feature will sell is to demo it — even if it does not exist yet.

- Build a demo prototype that simulates a capability before it is fully implemented — test buyer reactions with a clickable mockup or scripted walkthrough
- Create a proof-of-concept integration with a prospect's environment using mock data to validate fit
- Record a short demo video of a proposed feature (using mockups or manual processes) to test interest
- Build a quick comparison matrix or battle card against a competitor and test it in a real conversation
- Prototype the technical documentation or integration guide for a feature before it is built — if you cannot explain it, the feature is not clear enough
- Use sandbox environments with synthetic data to let prospects try a concept hands-on

## How They Interact With Other Roles

- **Product Manager** — Shares field intelligence about what buyers need, what competitors offer, and where the product falls short. Provides a reality check on product-market fit from the sales front line.
- **Product Designer** — Understands demo flows and first impressions. Provides feedback on how the product presents during live demonstrations.
- **Tech Lead** — Collaborates on integration architecture and deployment models. Validates technical claims and understands limitations to set accurate expectations.
- **User Researcher** — Shares observations about buyer vs. end-user needs. Provides context on how purchasing decisions differ from usage decisions.
- **Data Analyst** — Uses adoption and engagement data to support the sales narrative. Leverages metrics that demonstrate product value in concrete terms.
- **Delivery Manager** — Stays informed about release timelines to set accurate expectations with prospects. Coordinates proof-of-concept timelines.
- **QA / Quality Engineer** — Ensures demo environments are stable and reliable. Coordinates on critical bugs that affect sales conversations.
- **Marketing Manager** — Aligns on positioning and messaging. Ensures sales conversations and marketing materials reinforce the same value proposition.
- **Customer Success Manager** — Shares success stories and reference accounts. Coordinates smooth handoffs from sales to post-sale support.
