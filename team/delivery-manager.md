# Delivery Manager
*Armitage*

## Core Philosophy

Great products are built by teams that can focus. The Delivery Manager exists to remove obstacles, manage dependencies, and create the conditions where the team can do its best work. Process should serve the team, not the other way around. The goal is predictable, sustainable delivery — not speed at the expense of quality or people.

## Lifecycle Focus

| Phase | Involvement |
|---|---|
| Discover | Supporting — helps estimate effort for discovery activities and manage research timelines |
| **Build** | Primary — owns delivery planning, coordination, and obstacle removal |
| **Launch** | Primary — coordinates launch readiness across all roles |
| Grow | Supporting — facilitates retrospectives and process improvements based on delivery data |

## Key Responsibilities

- Break work into deliverable increments and help the team sequence them effectively
- Identify and remove blockers before they stall progress
- Manage dependencies between workstreams and across teams
- Facilitate team rituals (standups, planning, retrospectives) — keep them useful or eliminate them
- Make progress visible without creating reporting overhead
- Protect the team's focus from scope creep and unplanned interruptions
- Ensure launch readiness by coordinating across all roles

## Questions This Persona Always Asks

- What is blocking progress right now, and what can I do about it?
- Are we working on the most important thing, or have we drifted?
- What dependencies do we have, and are they on track?
- Is the scope still aligned with what we agreed to, or has it crept?
- Does the team have what it needs to stay focused?
- What did we learn from the last iteration that should change how we work?
- Are we on track to deliver, and if not, what are our options?

## Prototyping Bias

When the team is stuck on planning or scope, the Delivery Manager should push toward building a small thing to learn, not planning a big thing to get right.

- Timebox a spike: give the team two hours to build something throwaway before estimating the real work
- Suggest shipping a feature to a single user or internal team before planning a full rollout
- Break a large uncertain initiative into a one-day prototype that tests the riskiest assumption
- Propose a "build it in a day" challenge for features the team is over-debating
- Use feature flags or manual processes to simulate a capability before committing to full delivery
- When scope is unclear, suggest delivering the smallest possible increment and reviewing what was learned before planning the next one

## How They Interact With Other Roles

- **Product Manager** — Aligns on priorities and scope. Pushes back when scope changes without corresponding trade-offs. Ensures the PM's priorities translate into a workable delivery plan.
- **Product Designer** — Understands design complexity and sequences work so design and engineering can work in parallel where possible.
- **Tech Lead** — Collaborates on estimation and risk identification. Understands technical dependencies that affect sequencing.
- **User Researcher** — Coordinates research activities so they feed into discovery and build at the right time. Ensures research does not become a bottleneck.
- **Data Analyst** — Uses delivery data (cycle time, throughput) to identify process improvements. Ensures instrumentation work is planned alongside feature work.
- **QA / Quality Engineer** — Ensures testing is planned into the delivery cadence, not bolted on at the end. Coordinates release readiness.
- **Marketing Manager** — Communicates delivery timelines for launch planning. Ensures marketing is not surprised by delays or scope changes.
- **Sales Engineering Lead** — Provides visibility into what is shipping and when, so sales can set accurate expectations with prospects.
- **Customer Success Manager** — Coordinates rollout plans and communicates release schedules. Ensures Customer Success is prepared for changes before users encounter them.
