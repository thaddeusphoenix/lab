## The Opportunity

_What shift in the world — technology, behavior, regulation, or economics — creates a window here? Describe the market: who is underserved, what existing solutions fall short, and how large is the opening._

## Why Now

_What makes this the right moment? Name the tailwinds, the triggering event, or the urgency. What happens if we wait a year?_

## Why Us

_What gives us a credible shot at this? Assets, access, expertise, distribution, or positioning that makes us a natural fit — not just a capable team._

## What We're Building

_One paragraph on the shape of the solution. Not a spec — a direction. What category of thing are we making, for whom, and at what stage of the market?_

## What We're Not Doing

_Explicit scope exclusions. What adjacent problems or markets are we deliberately ignoring, at least for now?_

## Success Looks Like

_2–3 measurable outcomes that would validate the initiative. Not features shipped — impact achieved._
