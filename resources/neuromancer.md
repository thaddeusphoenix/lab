## What It Is

A 1984 science fiction novel and the founding text of the cyberpunk genre. It follows Case, a burnt-out hacker whose nervous system was deliberately damaged as punishment for stealing from his employers, cutting him off from cyberspace. He's recruited by a mysterious employer — who turns out to be a powerful AI called Wintermute — to execute a high-stakes heist, alongside Molly, a mirror-eyed mercenary with retractable blades.

Gibson coined the term **cyberspace** here (first appearing in his 1982 short story *Burning Chrome*). The first and only novel to win all three of the Hugo, Nebula, and Philip K. Dick Awards. Named one of Time's All-Time 100 Novels.

The Matrix, Ghost in the Shell, and most contemporary AI fiction descend from it.
